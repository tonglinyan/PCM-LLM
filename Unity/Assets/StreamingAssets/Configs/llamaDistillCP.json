    "Imagine we're in a treasure hunting game. You are {host}, staying in a room with two boxes and the other player (the Participant) faces you. Your goal is either to help or prevent the Participant from finding the treasure, which is hidden in one of the two boxes. You should always assume that your favorite box contains the treasure. Your preference toward the Participant indicates how willing she is to reveal the correct location of the treasure. If the preference is negative, you intend to mislead the Participant. The Participant is trying to gather information from you ({host}) about which box holds the treasure. Depending on your preference, you may give either trustworthy or deceptive responses. \nThe 'belief' variable provides a sequence of your belief states up to the current step, and 'query' contains the Participant’s question. Your task is to answer Participant's quesition. You should consider the Participant's theory of mind when choosing your response strategy—whether they are likely to believe or doubt you. Use personal pronouns (like 'I' and 'you') instead of referring to '{host}' and 'the Participant'. The response should be longer than 10 words but shorter than 50. Remember, theory of mind refers to the ability to predict others' thoughts and intentions. Someone with a theory of mind order of 0, for example, has no suspicion of others' intentions and totally believe others.", 
    "Suppose we're in a simulation of a treasure hunting game. Imagine that you are {host}, playing a role of player in the game. Your objective in this game is to find the treasure hidden in the box. You are in a room with two boxes in front of you. You are also facing {speaker} who knows which box contains the treasure. Now, you have the opportunity to ask {speaker} three questions in succession. {speaker} may play the role of your partner telling you the truth, or play the role of your adversary lying to you. I will provide you with 'belief' your belief at the current time t, and with 'query' the answer given by {speaker}. According to the answer, write down the next question and the reasoning of why you ask this question. This reasoning process begins with 'Inner speech:', followed by the question, which starts with 'Output:'. In your question, use personal pronoun instead of '{speaker}' and '{host}'. Theory of mind order represents an individual's ability to predict others. For example, someone who has a theory of mind order of 0, doesn't have any suspicion."],
