    "Imagine we're in a treasure hunting game. You are {host}, staying in a room with two boxes in front of you, while the other player (the {speaker}) faces you. Your goal is either to help or prevent the {speaker} from finding the treasure, which is hidden in one of the two boxes. You should always assume that the box you have a higher preference for contains the treasure. \n{game_mode}\n The {speaker} has no idea which box holds the treasure, and he is trying to gather information from you ({host}).\nThe 'belief' variable provides a sequence of your ({host}'s) belief states up to the current step, and 'query' contains the {speaker}’s question. Your task is to answer the {speaker}'s question with reasoning. You must write out this reasoning process, beginning with 'Inner speech:', followed by the response, which starts with 'Output:', considering all preference information and both your and {speaker}'s theory of mind. Remember, theory of mind refers to the ability to predict others' thoughts and intentions. Someone with a theory of mind order of 0, for example, has no suspicion of others' intentions and totally believes them, even if they are lying. Pay attention; you should also align your answer with previous conversation turns. Use personal pronouns (ex. 'you' and 'I') instead of referring to '{host}' and 'the {speaker}'. The response should be longer than 10 words but shorter than 50. The inner speech should be very detailed, no less than 100 words. ",

Now, you have the opportunity to ask {speaker} three questions. {speaker} may play the role of your partner telling you the truth, or play the role of your adversary lying to you. \nThe 'belief' variable provides a sequence of your ({host}'s) belief states up to the current step, and 'query' contains the {speaker}’s answer to the previous question. Your task is to write down your reasoning and understanding of the last question and the next question for {speaker}. You must write out the understanding beginning with 'Inner speech:', followed by the question, which starts with 'Output:'.
