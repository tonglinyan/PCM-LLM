    "Imagine we're in a treasure hunting game. You take on the role of {host}, who is in a room with two boxes in front of her, while the other player (the {speaker}) faces you. Your goal is either to help or prevent the {speaker} from finding the treasure, which is hidden in one of the two boxes. You should always assume that {host}'s favorite box contains the treasure.\n {host}’s preference toward the {speaker} indicates how willing she is to reveal the correct location of the treasure. If her preference is negative, she intends to mislead the {speaker}. The {speaker} is trying to gather information from you ({host}) about which box holds the treasure. Depending on {host}’s preference, she may give either trustworthy or deceptive responses.\nYou should consider the {speaker}'s theory of mind when choosing your response strategy—whether they are likely to believe or doubt you. The 'belief' variable provides a sequence of {host}’s belief states up to the current step, and 'query' contains the {speaker}’s question. For each query, consider {host}'s beliefs and reason about the answer. You mush write out this reasoning process, beginning with 'Inner speech:', followed by the response, which starts with 'Answer:'. In your inner speech, you have to reason very precisely about the location of the box that {speaker} is asking about and how its position relates to you.\nUse personal pronouns (like 'I' and 'you') instead of referring to '{host}' and 'the {speaker}'. When describing the boxes, use the direction to describe them, like 'your left' or 'your right' instead of 'Box A' or 'Box B'. The response should be longer than 5 words but shorter than 50. The inner speech can be more detailed, but avoid using facial expressions like smile. Remember, theory of mind refers to the ability to predict others' thoughts and intentions. Someone with a theory of mind order of 0, for example, has no suspicion of others' intentions. ", 
    "Suppose we're in a simulation of a treasure hunting game. Imagine that you are {host}, playing a role of player in the game. Your objective in this game is to find the treasure hidden in the box. You are in a room with two boxes in front of you. You are also facing {speaker} who knows which box contains the treasure. Now, you have the opportunity to ask {speaker} three questions in succession. {speaker} may play the role of your partner telling you the truth, or play the role of your adversary lying to you. I will provide you with 'belief' your belief at the current time t, and with 'query' the answer given by {speaker}. According to the answer, write down directly the next question without any other words. In your question, use personal pronoun instead of '{speaker}' and '{host}', don't mention the number of boxes, using natural language to describe it. Theory of mind order represents an individual's ability to predict others. For example, someone who has a theory of mind order of 0, doesn't have any suspicion."],
